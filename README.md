Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
==========================

Notebooks about Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The PDEs examples are based on [FiPy](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/), a finite volume PDE solver for Python.

## Tools and software
* [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release/), the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation
* [ObsPy](https://github.com/obspy/obspy), a Python framework for seismology
